<a name="Selection_Criteria"></a><h2> Selection Criteria </h2>
<p>
The following gives some indication of some of the things we are looking for. There will
probably be some subjective elements to it, but it's hoped that by trying to quantify the
decision process, it'll help people understand why their application was or was not
accepted.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
Proposal is longer than a few sentences. We need some meat in the proposal in order to
even consider it.  

	</li><li>
Proposer has contacted us prior to the submission. This demonstrates a definite interest
in Thousand Parsec and proves an ability to communicate with us.

	</li><li>
Proposer knows the appropriate programming language(s).

	</li><li>
Proposer shows evidence of being able to create software. Our goal is to help programmers
become good at Open Source, not to teach non-programmers how to program. However, we are
willing to help people develop their programming skills.

	</li><li>
Proposal is well written. While we don't expect perfect English, we do expect that the
proposer took time to spell check, proofread it, organize it logically, and use
comprehendable grammar.

	</li><li>
Proposal demonstrates understanding of subject matter. We expect the proposer to do some
research, ask questions, and gain some understanding of the project they're proposing.
This gives us confidence that they'll be able to complete the project successfully.

	</li><li>
Proposal shows creativity. We like to see someone thinking outside the box, including
proposing ideas for projects we hadn't listed.

	</li><li>
Proposal is the only submission for the given task. Many proposals focus on the same few
tasks, so if you're the only person proposing to do a given project, that weighs in your
favor.

	</li><li>
Proposal shows implementation planning. If the author has broken the work out into a task
list, it shows that they know what they'll be doing.

	</li><li>
Proposal scope is realistic. 2 months goes fast. Proposals that are promising too much are
unlikely to be completed in a timely fashion. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following are conditions that result in automatic rejection:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reject: Group project proposed. Google has specified that groups MAY NOT
participate. Individuals only.</li>
    <li>Reject: Proposer is not a student. Requirement of the program.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Create a new Client</h1>
<p>
Thousand Parsec is designed to allow many different clients to connect to the same server
and still fully participate. Currently the <a href="/tp/downloads.php#tpclient-pywx">main
client</a> is written in Python. There is also a C++ client for KDE being developed.
</p><p>
We want you to write a new client for Thousand Parsec. This client will service people who
are not in a situation to use tpclient-pywx.
</p><p>
These tasks are a reasonable amount of work, depending on which language you choose you
may need to improve (or implement from scratch) a protocol library. You will need to be a
reasonable coder before you start any of these projects if you hope to succeed.
</p>

<h1>Improve tpserver-cpp</h1>
<p>
tpserver-cpp is one of the main servers in Thousand Parsec. These project ideas deal with
improving it in various ways.
</p><p>
You will need some C++ skills before you start any of these projects (but not as much as
if you where implementing a ruleset for this server).

<p>
These projects are about improving or creating standalone tools for Thousand Parsec. They
are the mostly self contain projects, however it is still expected that you be involved
with the rest of the project.
</p><p>
Some of these projects might require you to extend the Thousand Parsec protocol or specify
out new features. These will need to be public discussed on the mailing lists.

Meet strange and interesting races... and kill them.  One of the core tenants of the
modern 4X game.  Race design for Stars! is an art form, with few major race strategies
(HP, HG, -F...), and dozens of minor variations.  Other games feature fixed races - do you
play the strange robotic machines, or the orange giant insects of Epsilon Persei III.
</p><p>
The goal for this project is to design and implement a protocol for player races.
Protocol and server support are a necessity, as is a (portable) client that can create
races in some way.  Race files will need to be saved and distributed..  Take into account
both fixed races (ala Master of Orion) or races built using another ruleset (ala Stars!).
Also you will need to have at least one implementation of a game that uses the races in
some way - easiest is Minisec, but if others are working on another project building a
ruleset, you may work with them.  Race files need to be verified in some manner on the
server, so take into account how to do this easily.

<h1>Improve the protocol</h1>
<p>
These projects are about improving a core part of Thousand Parsec. They may require a
smaller amount of code then other projects, but the code will have to be of a much higher
quality.
</p><p>
Any changes to the core protocol will need to be vetted by other Thousand Parsec members
and approved. This means that these projects may be slower to progress and more
frustrating. They will generally be more rewarding as you will know that you have helped
with a fundamental part of Thousand Parsec and every one else is doing work based on
yours.

Different trees for different races/players is also a common feature.  Variable tech
levels (Weapons vs Construction) must be supported as well technology with different
requirements.  
</p><p>
Obviously this requires extensions to the TP protocol - it's the main feature.  Also you
will need to expand a client and server to support it, along with an example in a ruleset.
Once again this may be good to do in a group with someone else implementing the core rules
why you focus on this aspect.

<h1>Implement a new Ruleset</h1>
<p>
Thousand Parsec's greatest strength is that it is a protocol for describing games, not a
single game ruleset.  Obviously then the more (complete) rulesets the better.
</p><p>
You can choose to implement the rulesets in either the 
<a href="http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=tpserver-py;a=summary">Python Server</a> 
or in the 
<a href="http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=tpserver-cpp;a=summary">C++ Server</a>.
Both servers currently only implement <a href="/tp/dev/documents/minisec.php">MiniSec</a>
but have been designed to support a wide variety of other rulesets.
</p><p>
All these tasks will require C++ skills (if developing for the C++ Server) or Python (if
developing for the Python Server). You may need to do some work on the core of the server
if you are doing more advanced stuff too.

<p>
In 1981 SSI released "Reach for the Stars", a classic in the 4X genre.  The rules for the
game itself were fairly simple - in the mechanics for everything except combat were in the
rule book.   It allowed up to 4 players, although it lacked decent network play (not a
surprise -- the internet as we know it was quite a few years in the future).   
</p><p>
TP is currently at a stage were most, if not all, of RFTS can be implemented in the
current protocol.  The game itself was balanced (by virtue of identical races) but had
more then enough depth to keep players coming back.

The goal of this project is to implement RFTS as a TP ruleset in any server.  Additionally
you may need to make adjustments to a client to support it.  The RFTS AI's are a challenge
for the truly adventurous.  
</p><p>
A new version of RFTS was released some years later.  It also could be used as a ruleset,
however it is a much more ambitous project, and would require a lot of work to expand the
TP protocol.

One of the greatest board (and later computer) games is Avalon Hills
Diplomacy game.  Focusing on diplomacy between the players, forcing them
to ally, lie, cheat, support and often backstab each other the game was
(and is) a classic.  Without the diplomacy aspect it becomes a fairly
average war game - with the diplomacy aspect, it's simple support-based
combat system, secret orders and general tight confines make for an
engaging and deep gaming experience.  
</p><p>
TP itself is missing some basic in turn messaging, but otherwise a
ruleset using some of the ideas from Diplomacy to create fairly simple
diplomatic game - in space could be done.  Some work on how to turn
adjacent countries/territories into space fleets need to done.
</p><p>
The goal of this project is to implement a Diplomacy style game - one
focused on shifting alliances and political manoeuvring, rather then
pure military might.  Messaging between players will need to implemented
in a server and client, and minor protocol adjustments will need to be
made to allow messaging between players.
