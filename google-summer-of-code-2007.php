<h1>Google Summer of Code 2007</h1>
<h6>Last updated: 15 March 2007</h6>

<p>Thousand Parsec is one of the mentoring organisations for Google Summer of Code 2007.
This is a great chance for all students to work on a cool open source game project during
the summer of 2007, have fun and earn some money during the process.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>Below are some of the ideas and suggestion for students who are interested in joining
Thousand Parsec project. The list is not definitive and any student is more than welcome
to come up with their own idea to work on.</p>

<h3>Implement MTSec game in one server</h3>
<p>Currently Thousand Parsec servers only implement a very simple game we call MiniSec.
To make the game more interesting and challenging a more complex game needs to be implemented
in any of the servers. The rules and properties of this new game are already defined in a
game we call MTSec (short for Missile and Torpedo Wars). For more information see
<a href="/tp/dev/documents/mtsec.php">MTSec documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Web based client</h3>
<p>Web based client enables players to join Thousand Parsec games easily from any computer
with a web browser and internet connection. This makes web based client the fastest and
easiest way to start playing the game.</p>

<h3>Improve the XSLT document generation</h3>

<h3>Improve the metaserver - make it standalone</h3>

<p>For additional ideas we encourage students to look at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=132078&atid=829724">Thousand Parsec TODO list</a>.</p>
