<h1>Google Summer of Code 2007</h1>
<h6>Last updated: 15 March 2007</h6>

<p>Thousand Parsec is one of the mentoring organisations for
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code 2007</a>.
This is a great chance for all students to work on a cool open source game project during
the summer of 2007, have fun and earn some money during the process.</p>
</p><p>
This page highlights ideas and suggestions for student proposals for 2007.

<p>
If you find an <a href="#General_Ideas">idea listed below</a> that you like or have your
own idea for a Thousand Parsec open source project, we encourage you to read up about the
<a href="/tp/gettingstarted.php">Getting Started Page</a>, <a href="#Questions"
title="">ask questions</a>, and then include the following in your proposal: </p>
<ol>
	<li>detailed description / design document</li>
	<li>an approximate schedule (timeline)</li>
	<li>brief description of past projects (including open source) that you've participated in</li>
	<li>brief resume/bio/contact information</li>
</ol>

<a name="Selection_Criteria"></a><h2> Selection Criteria </h2>
<p>
The following gives some indication of some of the things we are looking for. There will
probably be some subjective elements to it, but it's hoped that by trying to quantify the
decision process, it'll help people understand why their application was or was not
accepted.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
Proposal is longer than a few sentences. We need some meat in the proposal in order to
even consider it.  

	</li><li>
Proposer has contacted us prior to the submission. This demonstrates a definite interest
in Thousand Parsec and proves an ability to communicate with us.

	</li><li>
Proposer knows the appropriate programming language(s).

	</li><li>
Proposer shows evidence of being able to create software. Our goal is to help programmers
become good at Open Source, not to teach non-programmers how to program. However, we are
willing to help people develop their programming skills.

	</li><li>
Proposal is well written. While we don't expect perfect English, we do expect that the
proposer took time to spell check, proofread it, organize it logically, and use
comprehendable grammar.

	</li><li>
Proposal demonstrates understanding of subject matter. We expect the proposer to do some
research, ask questions, and gain some understanding of the project they're proposing.
This gives us confidence that they'll be able to complete the project successfully.

	</li><li>
Proposal shows creativity. We like to see someone thinking outside the box, including
proposing ideas for projects we hadn't listed.

	</li><li>
Proposal is the only submission for the given task. Many proposals focus on the same few
tasks, so if you're the only person proposing to do a given project, that weighs in your
favor.

	</li><li>
Proposal shows implementation planning. If the author has broken the work out into a task
list, it shows that they know what they'll be doing.

	</li><li>
Proposal scope is realistic. 2 months goes fast. Proposals that are promising too much are
unlikely to be completed in a timely fashion. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following are conditions that result in automatic rejection:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reject: Group project proposed. Google has specified that groups MAY NOT
participate. Individuals only.</li>
    <li>Reject: Proposer is not a student. Requirement of the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>
Below are some of the ideas and suggestion for students who are interested in joining
Thousand Parsec project. The list is not definitive and any student is more than welcome
to come up with their own idea to work on. Initiative is a very good skill.
</p><p style='font-size: 18px'>
The list is not definitive and any student is more than welcome to come up with their own
idea to work on. Initiative is a skill which will rate highly when selecting projects.
Feel free to come up with your own projects.

<p>
Currently, Thousand Parsec servers only implement a very simple game we call MiniSec. To
make the game more interesting and challenging a more complex game needs to be implemented
in one of the servers. The rules and properties of this new game are already defined in a
game we call MTSec (short for Missile and Torpedo Wars).
</p><p>
You can choose to implement the game in either the 
<a href="http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=tpserver-cpp;a=summary">Python Server</a> 
or in the 
<a href="http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=tpserver-py;a=summary">C++ Server</a>.

A web based client enables players to join Thousand Parsec games easily from any computer
with a web browser and internet connection. This makes web based client the fastest and
easiest way to start playing the game.

Any language could be used for the client. Some suggestions are 
<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> or 
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. It might be a good idea to use
