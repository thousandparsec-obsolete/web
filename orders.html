		<li> Move
		  <ul>
			<li>Warp drive
			  Warp drives move through normal space at a speed greater then light.
			  Higher speed uses more fuel, possibility of "ram scoop" engines which 
			  can get fuel from space at lower speeds.
			  Requires: Destination, Speed
			</li>
			<li>Jump drive
			  Jump drives jump directly to the destination without parseing through
			  the points inbetween. They take a long time to charge and without
			  "space anchors" never really turn up at the extact destination.
			  How long the engine charges for increases the accuracy. Longer
			  distances have less acurracy. Most distances have a "minimum"
			  charge time.
			  Requires: Destination, ChargeTime
			</li>
			<li>Link drives
			  Use "holes" in space to go from one system to another. These drives
			  just open the holes which already exist. (At higher tech levels
			  "holes" can be created and destoryied).
			  Requires: Hole to enter
			</li>
			<li>Grav accel drives
			  As used by packet accelerators, once in transit no course change can
			  be made. These drives don't use any fuel at all, how ever ships are
			  damanged in transport. Max speed is determined by the maximum damanage
			  the ship can withstand.
			  Requires: Destination, Speed
			</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li> Colonise
		  Colonise the currently orbiting planet.
		</li>
		<li> Deploy space station
		  Like colonise but deploys a space station. Used for races which can't exist
		  on a planet.
		</li>
		<li> Deploy space anchor
		  Create a space anchor so that jump ships can reliably jump to this location
		</li>
		<li> Create "hole"
		  Create a "hole" from this system to the target system.
		  Longer distances require exponentionally more energy.
		</li>
		<li>Mine
		  Mines the current location. (Used for remote mining operations)
		</li>
		<li>Transport
		  <ul>
			<li>Pickup
			  How much of what?

			<li>Drop off
			  How much of what?

			<li>Transfer
			  How much of what?

		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>??Tow??
		  Drags a target to a destination, used by tug boats etc..
		</li>
		<li>Attack
		  Attack and enemy
		</li>
		<li>Lay mines
		  Lay mines at a location
		</li>
