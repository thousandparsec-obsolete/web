<h2>How to Help for the Unmotivated</h2>

<p>
Here are some cool stuff that would add a little spice to the
game and requires only a little effort. Everyone who has been meaning to
do stuff and never got around to is should try out one of these.
</p><p>
Any code which works and is in python would kick ass :)
</p><p>
So take your pick and get coding/drawing/composing right NOW! We are expecting
your contribution :)

<h3>Random Generators</h3>
<p>
All these results should be "seeded" generators so that we can get the
same results by putting in the same number(s).
</p><p>
<b>Text Generators:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Planet Name Generator</li>
	<li>Planet Description Generator</li>
	<li>Fleet Name Generator</li>
	<li>'Lost' Civilisations description Generator</li>
	<li>Space Pirate names Generator</li>
	<li>Space Phenomena Generator</li>
	<li>Random Insult Generator</li>
	<li>Random Weapon name Generator</li>
	<li>Random Weapon result Generator</li>
</ul>
See <a href="http://www.seventhsanctum.com/">http://www.seventhsanctum.com/</a> for ideas and hints
</p><p>
<b>Graphics Generators:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Planet Graphic Generator</li>
	<li>Sun Graphic Generator</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Could write the above in anything - Gimp scripts come to mind. See
<a href="http://www.pandromeda.com/page/products/generator.html">http://www.pandromeda.com/page/products/generator.html</a>
for a super cool program which does this.

<h3>Media</h3>
<p>
As well the following graphics are needed,
<ul>
	<li>Thousand Parsec Logo</li>
	<li>"Touch Up" website background (it's VERY slow on modem...)</li>
	<li>Fix up the windows HOWTO graphics</li>
	<li>General ship, planet, star, sun, moon, spacey object generators</li>
</ul>
Some cool subtle space music for the background would be cool too!
</p><p>
As well the website is always in need of improvement. Write us a RSS feed
system or something.
