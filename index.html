		<p>Thousand Parsec (TP) homepage.. Please come back soon when we have one :)</p>
		<p>TP is a 4 X's game (eXplore, eXpand, eXterminate, i forget what the other one is :) but it is
		diffrent in the sense that it is designed for long games supporting universes as large as your
		computer can handle. (Have a quad Xeon with 4 gig of ram? Well have a couple of million systems
		in your universe! :). It also supports long term play with players joing and leaving throughout
		the game. As well the tech tree is easily expandable and can be extended during the game without
		effecting anybody already playing (ie introduction of new technology as the game progresses).</p>
		<p>You can choose to have highly exotic universes where the laws of physics are totally diffrent
		or universes that are very similar to our own.</p>
		<p> Well defined protocol for transfering objects between the server and the client allow anyone
		to write a client.</p>
		<p> The game is TURN BASED, this means that click quickly isn't vital but stratergy is.</p>
		<p> The game should also be highly extendable. Allowing player customisation not found
		in the commercial games.</p>
		<p>Anyway we have high hopes for what TP will become. We have currently stolen alot of ideas from
		Stars!, VGA Planets an XPace.</p>
