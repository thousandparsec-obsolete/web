soon when we have one :)</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">TP is a 4 X's game (eXplore, eXpand, eXterminate,
i forget what the other one is :) but it is diffrent in the sense that
it is designed for long games supporting universes as large as your computer
can handle. (Have a quad Xeon with 4 gig of ram? Well have a couple of
million systems in your universe! :). It also supports long term play with
players joing and leaving throughout the game. As well the tech tree is
easily expandable and can be extended during the game without effecting
anybody already playing (ie introduction of new technology as the game
progresses).</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">You can choose to have highly exotic universes
where the laws of physics are totally diffrent or universes that are very
similar to our own.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well defined protocol for transfering objects
between the server and the client allow anyone to write a client.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The game is TURN BASED, this means that click
quickly isn't vital but stratergy is.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The game should also be highly extendable. Allowing
player customisation not found in the commercial games.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway we have high hopes for what TP will become.
We have currently stolen alot of ideas from Stars!, VGA Planets an XPace.</font>
