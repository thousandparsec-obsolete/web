TP is a 4 X's game (eXplore, eXpand, eXterminate, eXploit) but it is diffrent
in the sense that it is designed for long games supporting universes as large 
as your computer can handle. (Have a quad Xeon with 4 gig of ram? Well have a
couple of million systems in your universe! :). It also supports long term 
play with players joing and leaving throughout the game. As well the tech tree 
is easily expandable and can be extended during the game without effecting 
anybody already playing (ie introduction of new technology as the game 
progresses).
</p><p>
You can choose to have highly exotic universes where the laws of physics are 
totally diffrent or universes that are very similar to our own.
</p><p>
The game is TURN BASED, this means that clicking quickly isn't vital but 
stratergy is.
</p><p>
The game should also be highly extendable. Allowing player customisation not 
found in the commercial games.
</p><p>
Anyway we have high hopes for what TP will become. We have currently stolen 
alot of ideas from Stars!, VGA Planets an XPace.
