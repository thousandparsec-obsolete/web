<h2>Libtprl 0.1.1 released.</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	Bug fix version for configuration/install issues and wrong include order issues. No changes to
	the actual library. All 0.1.x releases will be interface compatable. Hopefully documentation 
	makes it in soon.
</p>
<p>
	Libtprl 0.1.1 is on the downloads page and is on our SF downloads page too. The Darcs repo is 
	libtprl and the tag is 
	libtprl_0_1_1. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
