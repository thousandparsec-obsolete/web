<h2>Rename stuff</h2>
<p>by Mithro</p>
<p>
	Well as Lee said we have renamed almost everything. The clients are now named 
	tpclient-&lt;old prefix&gt;. The servers have been named tpserver-&lt;old prefix&gt;. So for example the
	cpp-server is not called tpserver-cpp and the pywx-client is now called tpclient-pywx.
</p>
<p>
	The reason we renamed the packages was to improve package naming for Debian and related 
	Linux systems.
