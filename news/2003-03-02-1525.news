<h2>TP-Server 0.0.2 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	I have just tagged and released 0.0.2 of the Thousand Parsec
	Server.  The tag in the CVS is CPP_SERVER_0_0_2.
	You can download it from <a href="downloads.php">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The server now sends in-game objects to clients that request them
	and the tutorial universe it created by default.  The universe can 
	be loaded from file at the server console.  This means that
	the server is at Milestone Alpha.
