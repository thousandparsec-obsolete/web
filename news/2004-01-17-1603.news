<h2>TP-Server 0.0.4rc2 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	I have just released 0.0.4rc2 of the TP-server.  The only change in
	this version is the addition of support for the TP02 protocol, while
	maintaining backward compatiblity with TP01.  Again, this is an 
	untested release, any bugs should be reported to me or on the mailing 
	list.
</p>
<p>
	All the normal stuff.  CVS tag: CPP_SERVER_0_0_4RC2.  Tarball on the 
	downloads page.
