<h2>Qtopia client for mobile phones and devices</h2>

<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia">Qtopia</a> is a platform that powers many <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia/qtopiainuse/qtopiadevices">mobile phones and other mobile devices</a>. <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a>, the company behind Qtopia, has recently started a <a href="http://trolltech.com/developer/tt/grant/grantprogram">Qtopia Greenphone Grant Program</a> in order to help developers get their hands on the actual hardware so that they can create innovative new software.

<a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/">Thousand Parsec</a> project and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X</a> space strategy game fans can be happy today, as my submitted application for the grant got accepted. In it I proposed to develop a free and open source Qtopia-based client for playing 4X space strategy games based on Thousand Parsec project. So if all goes well any owner of a Qtopia based mobile device will be able to play with us. I also invite anyone with such a Qtopia based device to consider helping me with testing.
