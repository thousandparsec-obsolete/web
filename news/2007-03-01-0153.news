<h2>TPServer-cpp 0.4.1 released.</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	Another big update, mostly bug fixes and small improvements.
	There are so many little things, go check 
	the Change Log or <a href="http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=tpserver-cpp;a=shortlog">darcs shortlog</a>. Big things include:
	non-blocking tps and https sockets, Mersenne Twister
	random number generator, better console, support for 
	guile 1.8, more portable using libltdl. Mithro even has 
	it running under cygwin for windows (unsupported though).  
	See the ChangeLog and/or the darcs history for more.
