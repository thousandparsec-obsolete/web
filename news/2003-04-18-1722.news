<h2>TP-Server 0.0.3 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	I have just tagged and released 0.0.3 of the Thousand Parsec
	Server.  The tag in the CVS is CPP_SERVER_0_0_3.
	You can download it from <a href="downloads.php">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The server now describes orders when asked, and objects define 
	what orders they can perform on a pre player basis and will accept
	orders which can also be removed.  This means that
	the server is at Milestone Charlie.
