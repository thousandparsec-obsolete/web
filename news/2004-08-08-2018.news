<h2>TP-Server 0.0.7 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	That didn't take long either.  I have just released 0.0.7 of the C++ TP-server. 
	Any bugs to the mailing list please.  Three things in this release: Updated configure
	stuff and other things for Debian (and everyone else too), Message boards are now working,
	and my second refactoring is in as well.
</p>
<p>
	All the normal stuff.  CVS tag: CPP_SERVER_0_0_7.  Tarball and pgp sig on the 
	downloads page.
