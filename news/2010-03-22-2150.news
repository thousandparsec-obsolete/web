<h2>Libtprl 0.1.3 released.</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	New version to catch up with compilers and changes in the last 3 years. Mostly small things
	but ezod has rewritten the tokenizing to work better. 
	All 0.1.x releases should be interface compatible. Hopefully documentation 
	makes it in soon.

	Libtprl 0.1.3 is on the downloads page and will be on alternative hosting shortly. The Git repo is 
	libtprl and the tag is 
	LIBTPRL_0_1_3. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
