<h2>Thousand Parsec accepted into Google Summer of Code 2008!</h2>
<p>by JLP</p>
<p>Google has just published the list of accepted mentoring organizations for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>. We are extremely happy to report that <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/parsec/about.html">Thousand Parsec</a> is one of the projects which will have the opportunity to mentor aspiring open source developers.</p>
<p>A few words about us for people who might be interested into Thousand Parsec. Our project is all about turn-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x_game">4X</a> space strategy games, where the player gets to build his very own space empire. We mostly use Python and C++. There is also some code written in Java and PHP. Of course people who know other languages are most welcome too.</p>
<p>If you are interested into having fun developing an open source game and don't mind US$ 4500 of encouragement to go with it, be sure to check these two webpages:<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Ideas_for_Programmers">Thousand Parsec Wiki - Ideas for Programmers</a></li></ul></p>
<p>We're sure we will all be as successful as we were last year. Let the fun begin!</p>
