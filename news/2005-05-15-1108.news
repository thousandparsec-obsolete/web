<h2>TPServer-cpp 0.1.1 released.</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	This release adds almost all of TP03, and a few other improvements which you can find in the changelog or
	cvs commit history. The server is still running minisec rules. Missing from TP03 is designs and components, 
	and the secure and tunneling sockets.
</p>
<p>
	TPServer-cpp 0.1.1 is on the downloads page. The CVS module is tpserver-cpp and the tag is 
	TPSERVER_CPP_0_1_1. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
