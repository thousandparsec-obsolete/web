<h2>Summer of Code results!</h2>
<p>by Mithro</p>
<p>
I have been meaning to do a Summer of Code round-up/results report for a while
now, but had been putting it off until I could get some statistics from <a
href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679?p=Thousand+Parsec">Ohloh</a>. As they
have now fixed the problem they where having with git branches, there is no
excuses. I have previously mentioned my thoughts about the program on <a
href="http://blog.mithis.net/archives/category/summer-of-code/">my own blog</a>
but I'm going to provide a more comprehensive wrap-up of our Summer of Code.
</p><p>
If you have a good memory (or just look through our history) you will remember
that we had 4 students participating. By the end of the Summer 3 students has
successfully completed their projects. According to <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Oholo</a>,
over the summer the students made a total of <b>371</b> commits to our public
repository, changing a total of <b>39,050</b> lines of code. As well, over the
next couple of months most of the code that the students have written will be
released for everyone to use. The successful projects are listed below.
</p><ul>
   <li>
			Metaserver rewrite and improvement, 
		done by 
		<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679/contributors/41715">
			Donata Ma≈Çecka aka 'niphree'</a>. 
<p>
The code that Donata has developed will be deployed on the primary 
<a href="http://metaserver.thousandparsec.net/">metaserver</a>
pending a few small fixes. This should give people the ability to view
statistics about our servers including nice graphs.
</p>

		<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/parsec/appinfo.html?csaid=8EFC02A014D712EF">
			Reach for the Stars ruleset for the C++ Server</a> 
		done by 
		<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679/contributors/46696">
			Tyler Shaub aka xdotx</a>.
<p>
The <a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpserver-cpp.git;a=shortlog;h=rfts">ruleset</a>
is pretty stable and we should have a server or two running in the near future.
Currently it only implements the simple version of the RFTS ruleset, but Tyler
will hopefully be working on adding support for the advanced features in his
"copious amounts of free time".

   <li>
		<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/parsec/appinfo.html?csaid=450330A2492DDC71">
			Ruleset Development Environment</a> 
		done by 
		<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679/contributors/36081">
			James Gardner aka DystopicFro</a>.
<p>
Over the next couple of months we hope to release the 
<a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpruledev.git;a=summary">Ruleset Development Environment (RDE)</a>
 into the public. This will hopefully allow people to start developing their
own rulesets with ease. James has committed to further development and has a
ton of really good ideas.

Participating in the <a href="http://www.google.com/soc">Summer of Code</a> has
meant that students from around the world have started trying to figure out how
to make Thousand Parsec part of their course work. 
</p><p>
One such student is 
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679/contributors/46709">
Nathan Partlan aka greywhind</a> who is doing a full year internship with
Thousand Parsec. He is helping me to make some much needed improvements to 
<a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpclient-pywx.git;a=summary">tpclient-pywx</a>
and has already pushed multiple changes into the incoming branch.
</p><p>
Over the next 6 months, it is likely that students from the 
<a href="http://www.unisa.edu.au/">University of South Australia</a> will be
working on developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midp">Java MIDP
client</a>. This should allow anyone to login to a server from their Java
enabled mobile phone!
</p><p>
If you are a student (or just anyone!) who wants to get in on some of this cool
action, feel free to send us an 
<a href="mailto:developers@thousandparsec.net">email</a>, 
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/#tp">jump on IRC</a> or 
<a href="/tp/mailman.php/listinfo/">join the mailing lists</a>.  
We have a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=132078&amp;atid=829724">todo
tracker</a> which lists some ideas which you could get started with, feel
free to suggest your own ideas. There are both coding and <b>non-coding</b> tasks!
</p><p>
As you can see the Summer of Code has been really great. Not only have we have
had some cool code produced the program has opened up opportunities we had not
even considered before. Hopefully Google will let us participate again next
year!
