<h2>TP-Server 0.0.4 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	I have just released 0.0.4 of the TP-server.  No real changes have
	been made.  TP02 support has been fix, and IPv6 support has been
	added.  There may be issues with orders as the TP02 Protocol frames
	for them have not been reviewed yet, dash releases might be released
	if needed.
</p>
<p>
	All the normal stuff.  CVS tag: CPP_SERVER_0_0_4.  Tarball on the 
	downloads page.
