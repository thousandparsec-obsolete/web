<h2>TP-Server 0.0.3 patched</h2>

	Wow, that was a bug!  Mithro and I have just fixed a bug in the 
	server. It caused the server to try to allocate over 768MB for a
	frame.  I have updated the tag and the tarball.  All versions to
	date are affected and I am not going to fix them.  Do not use 
	versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 of the server.
