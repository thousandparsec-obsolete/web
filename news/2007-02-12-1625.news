<h2>Another AI Competition Update.</h2>
<p>by Mithro</p>
<p>
I have updated the competition page with a new <a
href="/tp/comp.php#links">links section</a>.  This should make it easier to find
all the helpful libraries that already exist for languages such as Python and
C++.

Get hacking, only ~3 weeks and a month left until you have to submit your
entries. The deadline is the <b>31st of March</b>.
