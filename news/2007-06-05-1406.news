<h2>More good news!</h2>

During the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Summer of Code</a> we got a lot
of very good applications.  Through the program Google agreed to fund 3
students are previously mentioned, but there is even more good news.
</p><p>
Google, in support of getting women into Open Source development, has agreed to
provide funding for another student outside the Summer of Code. Her name is
Donata Ma≈Çecka from Poland and will be working to improve our Metaserver and
add match making services.
</p><p>
We thank Google very much for supporting Donata and welcome her aboard!
