<h2>TP-Server 0.0.5rc1 released</h2>
<p>by Lee</p>
<p>
	I have just released 0.0.5rc1 of the TP-server.  End of Turn support
	is in and working.  Nop and Move orders work on fleet objects. So
	you now can explore a little bit.  The server will do End of Turn
	every 10 minutes at the moment.

<p>
	All the normal stuff.  CVS tag: CPP_SERVER_0_0_5RC1.  Tarball on the 
	downloads page.
