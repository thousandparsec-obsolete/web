	I have just released 0.0.5 of the TP-server.  A bit of code clean up, fixed a
	bug in recontainisation.  Fleets move to the right container at end of turn.  
	Look out for 0.0.6rc1 before next weekend. Any bugs to the mailing list please.

	All the normal stuff.  CVS tag: CPP_SERVER_0_0_5.  Tarball and pgp sig on the 
	downloads page.
