<h2>Webpage updated</h2>
<p>by Mithro</p>
<p>
	The webpage has been updated and now uses PHP for templates.
	I've added a "<a href="/tp/milestones.php">milestones</a>" document
	which describes our target milestones.<br>
	I've also added a "<a href="/tp/orders.php">orders</a>" document
	which describes possible orders to be added to the game.
