<h2>Thousand Parsec at LCA 2005</h2>
<p>by Mithro</p>
<p>
	I mentioned Thousand Parsec at a lighting talk in 
	<a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au 2005</a>. I also mentioned it
	at the end of my Worldforge.

	Hopefully this will increase our numbers and help the project move along a bit
	faster.
