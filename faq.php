<h2>1.3 On which operating system can I play Thousand Parsec?</h2>
<p>
	This depends on the client you are using to play the game. Thousand Parsec is
a free and open source project so clients can be made for any operating system. Currently
the most usable client is wxPython based client (tpclient-pywx). It is known to run
on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

<h2>1.4 Can I only make/build/play turn based space strategy games?</h2>
<p>
	While this is was we are primarily working on, other genre of turn based games
	might be possible. Have a look at the <a href="dev/documents/protocol3.php">protocol document</a>
	to see if it would capture your design. Note that there is still a lot of procotol development, and
	we are still adding concepts.
